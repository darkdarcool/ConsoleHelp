Welcome to ConsoleHelp, the package! This is made for new coders who need some help with python console applications!

We are currently in version `0.5.0`(half way to post) and we need more ideas! We need you guys to tell us what you stuffled with, so we can make it easier for you. (make it in a issue so can find it, you must provide an example for it)
